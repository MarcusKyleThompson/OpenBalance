# OpenBalance

## About This Project
Weight and Balance is an important step before flying any type of UAS. An idea to make a 4 scale system to determine fore/aft and left/right balance was devised after watching co-workers balance multirotor aircraft manual by suspending the boom arms and watching which direction they UAS tended to fall.
